# Module 12
Credit Risk Analysis

>Predict high risk loans

 
---
> This program uses a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.
---

The goal of the program is to achieve following:
* Using imbalanced-learn library, use a logistic regression model to compare two versions of the dataset
* First version of dataset is original data
* Second version of dataset has been resampled by using the RandomOverSampler module from the imbalanced-learn library
* Train a logistic regression classifier, calculate the balanced accuracy score, generate a confusion matrix and generate a classification report

## Technologies

> Program uses Python 3.10.6 version, Prophet 2.x version and Jupyter Lab

* Program uses 'Pandas' library to work with dataframes. 
* Program uses 'scikit-learn' library for modelling and running soem metrics such as accuracy score, confusion matrix.
* Program uses 'imblearn' library for over sampling and imbalanced classification report metrics.

## Installation Guide 

Program runs in jupyter. Therefore its important to install Jupyter. If you already have installed anaconda, then you already have installed Jupyter and few relevant libraries.

---
## Usage

> * Jupyter lab
> * Go to -> localhost:8888/lab/tree
> * Choose a Notebook
> * Use run function of Notebook
